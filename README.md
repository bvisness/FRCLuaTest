# 2021Lua
Getting Lua running in an FRC robot project.

This repo is an attempt to use Lua as the high-level programing language for the bot, this 2021 season.

To port C++ functions to Lua, we generate functions using Metadesk to be run using the LuaJit FFI for C.

To read more about the use of Metadesk, refer to [metadesk.md](metadesk.md)
